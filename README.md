# üîç Chronicle YARA-L Detection Rules Portfolio

This repository contains my custom-built **YARA-L detection rules for Google Chronicle SecOps**, developed through rigorous self-study, hands-on practice, and real-world detection logic for Tier 1 SOC analysis.

## üìå About This Project

These detection rules were crafted to identify suspicious and malicious activity across multiple telemetry fields in Chronicle, including:

- `file.name`
- `http.request.uri`
- `http.request.user_agent`
- `dns.question.name`
- `dns.question.name`
- `user.email`
- Hex-encoded payloads

Each rule includes meaningful metadata, clean logic, and real-world use cases ‚Äî ideal for SOC teams looking to strengthen visibility into common attack vectors.
